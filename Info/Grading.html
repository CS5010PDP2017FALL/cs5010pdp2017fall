    <h2>
    Codewalks
    </h2> 
    <p>Codewalks attempt to meet the following goals</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Learn how to effectively communicate your solution, design and implementation to others.</li>
        <li>Learn how to discuss pros and cons of a solution, design and implementation.</li>
        <li>Evaluate and accept/reject feedback on your solution, design and implementation.</li>
        <li>Be constructively critical of work presented to/by you.</li>
    </ol>
    <br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <h3> 
        Presentation
    </h3>
    <p>Some recommendations for your presentation</p>
    <p>
        <ol>
        <li>Present the problem you attempted to solve.</li>
        <li>Provide a simple explanation in English of the problem.</li>
        <li>Give examples providing inputs and outputs. Use these examples to nail down the problem.</li>
        <li>If there are special cases that require attention, state them and explain the reason why these cases require attention.</li>
        <li>Present an overview of your solution.</li>
        <li>Provide a clear mapping of the problem's information to data/classes.</li>
        <li>Provide an explanation of the role for each class.</li>
        <li>Use a diagram (Class Diagram).</li>
        <li>Provide a clear picture of the interactions between you classes.</li>
        <li>Provide an explanation of how interactions in your code achieve the desired outcome.</li>
        <li>Use an interactions/sequence diagram.</li>
        <li>Show how tests capture the cases (special or otherwise) that you covered at the start of your presentation.</li>
        </ol>

    <h2> 
        Codewalk Public General Rubric
    </h2>

    <p>This rubric describes the common, general points that we will always consider for all codewalks.</p>
    <p>For each week's codewalk there will be specific, problem related points that we will be looking for that will very with each assignment.</p>

    <p>The goal of our codewalks are</p>
    <ol>
        <li>To train students to write well designed, well organized and well documented code.</li>
        <li>To train students in explaining their logical solution(s) to their peers.</li>
        <li>To train students in explaining how their design and implementation follows their logical solution.</li>
        <li>To train students in listening and answering questions about their logical solution/design/implenentation.</li>
        <li>To train students in discussing pros and cons of their logical solution/design/implementation and propose alternatives.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The goal of this rubric is to provide a set of areas/questions to consider both while you are preparing for your codewalk but also while you are listening to someone else's codewalk. These areas/questions attempt to focus on what we have found to be decisive characteristics of the solution/design/code that can expose flaws</p>

    <h3> 
      Logical Solution
    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Can the presenter explain their logical solution in English?</li>
        <li>Does the logical solution have clear steps?</li>
        <li>Is the order of these steps clear?</li>
        <li>Do the steps lead to a correct solution to the problem?</li>
        <li>Can the presenter show using an example how their logical solution leads to a correct answer?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3> 
      Design
    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Does the presenter clearly map information from the problem to data?</li>
        <li>Does the presenter clearly map steps/operations in their design?</li>
        <li>Does the design follow our design rules</li>
        <li>One class one responsibility</li>
        <li>One task one method</li>
        <li>Only talk to your friends</li>
        <li>Are pre-, post-conditions and invariants clearly stated? Are they correct?</li>
        <li>Can the presenter list pros and cons of their design? Can we do better?</li>
        <li>Were alternative designs considered? If so what lead to selecting the current design?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3> 
      Implementation
    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Does the implementation follow the design?</li>
        <li>Does the code map to the logical solution</li>
        <li>Each step is clearly mapped</li>
        <li>The presenter can walk through a concrete example and show how the code behaves</li>
        <li>Code follows our rules</li>
          <ol type="i">
            <li>Meaningful names for class, fields, methods etc.</li>
            <li>Proper separation of Client code, implementation etc.</li>
            <li>No magic values</li>
            <li>Documentation is clear and the code does in fact behave as documented</li>
            <li>Cryptic methods</li>
            <li>Proper use of abstraction</li>
          </ol>
        <li>Can the presenter discuss the algorithmic complexity of their solution/implementation?</li>
    </ol> 

    <h3> 
      Presentation
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Can you hear the presenter when they speak?</li>
        <li>Do you understand the presenter when they speak?</li>
        <li>Does the presenter use the correct terminology?</li>
        <li>Does the presenter understand and answer the question asked?</li>
    </ol>
