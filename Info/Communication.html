  </h2> 
  <p>
      We will use Piazza as our primary platform for announcements, questions, discussions, and so forth. 
      Don't send email to the instructor or TAs unless it is absolutely necessary. Use Piazza instead. 
      Piazza allows you to create private messages, seen only by the instructor and TAs.
  </p>
  <p>
      Don't post your code or designs in a public post. 
      If you are asking a question that is relevant only to your own solution, make it a private question. 
      Better yet, think of a way to ask your question without giving anything away about your own solution or ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
      Before you post a question, read through the existing threads to see whether your question has already been answered.
  </p>
  <p>
        Make your subject line descriptive and tag your posts. Piazza uses hashtags, like Twitter. 
        Weâ€™ll create labels for each assignment and logistics so you can tag your posts as appropriate.
  </p>

  <p>
      Feel free to respond to other students' posts. We won't hold it against you if your response is incorrect. 
      Indeed, incorrect responses help us to identify things the class doesn't understand.
